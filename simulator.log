Climate change is also intricately linked to food production and security. Altered weather patterns, increased temperatures, and changing precipitation levels can harm crop yields and reduce the availability of freshwater resources. This, in turn, can lead to food shortages and higher food prices, with the potential to trigger conflicts and migration.

Disproportionate impacts are felt by vulnerable and marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities. Access to clean water, adequate housing, and healthcare is threatened by climate-related events, particularly in developing countries.

The economic toll of climate change is staggering. The damage from extreme weather events, as well as the cost of adapting to a changing climate, is
